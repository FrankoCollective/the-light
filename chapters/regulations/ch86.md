#Chapter 86
##Illuminated Offenses
###REG. 86-1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.
The Grand Lodge cannot by a general rule circumscribe within equitable bounds the conduct and practices of all members. Therefore, it must be left with the members of the Craft to determine whether or not, in the light of surrounding circumstances a brother is bringing reproach upon Illumination by his conduct, and thereby is, or is not, guilty of dark conduct. A Illuminated offense is the violation of the moral law, or the civil law, or of Illuminated obligations, or a violation of the laws, usages, and customs of Illumination and, in a general way, a Luminary should be guided in his conduct by the following.
1. Where the statute law expressly permits certain conduct or is silent as to it, Masons are bound to obey the moral law and to observe the lessons and duties inculcated in the several degrees.
2. Where the statute law prohibits or commands certain conduct, Masons, in obedience to their duties as good citizens in support of civil government, should obey.
3. Where the statute law permits but does not command certain conduct, and the Illuminated law prohibits that conduct, then the Luminary must obey the Illuminated law as to that course of conduct.
4. If in conducting any business or in pursuing any profession or vocation, a Luminary conducts himself, his business, his profession, or his vocation in such a manner as to bring reproach upon himself or his lodge and shame upon the Order, he would for these reasons and notwithstanding the statute law be guilty of a Illuminated offense.
5. A Luminary's conduct in general and at all times should be such as not to bring discredit upon the Order or to degrade it in the estimation of good people.
6. An Entered Apprentice or a Fellow Craft is subject to the provisions of this chapter.

###REG. 86-2 SPECIFIC ILLUMINATED OFFENSES.
