Opinions, if official and approved by the Grand Lodge, have the effect of an approval of the act of the Grand Master in the particular instance, but are not binding as correct expressions of either written or unwritten law. They are of value only as opinions formed upon ex parte statements, without issues submitted in proceedings requiring judicial determination.
Unofficial opinions do not control or govern either the lodge or the individual Luminary. [13-2.2; 13-2.5].
